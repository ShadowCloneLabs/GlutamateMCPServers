## About MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol for managing and serving AI models with their associated context. It enables:

- Efficient model deployment
- Context management
- Model versioning
- Resource optimization
- Scalable inference

## Road Map:
- Auto Sync with any client (coming in next update!!)

## Custom Made Servers

Our repository includes several custom MCP servers that are created by Glutamate Team , We support all stdio and sse server that are node based on our glutamate app

### UI Assist

Located in the `src/uiassist` directory, UI Assist is a specialized server that provides enhanced user interface capabilities for MCP servers. It offers:

- Custom UI components
- Improved user experience
- Streamlined navigation
- Modern interface design

More servers will be added to this repository in the future, expanding the available options for MCP administrators.


## Getting Started

1. Visit [glutamateapp.com](https://glutamateapp.com)
2. Download the app
3. Choose your desired MCP server from the available options
4. Click to install and just connect
